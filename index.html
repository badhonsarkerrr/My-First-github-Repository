        <h3>MY Second WEBSITE</h3>
        <p>Aldous Huxley writes, “Words can be like X-rays if you use them
            properly — they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.” It
            is true as whenever we wish to share our innermost thoughts with
            others, we do it through words- either by writing or by reading.Words,
            when written, provide an appropriate outlet to our conscious and
            unconscious emotions. We tend to write about the things we experience
            in our daily lives; incidents that have shaped up our personalities; people
            who have directly or indirectly affected our lives. Diary Writing is one
            such form.</p>

            documents of the twentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has been
